  <P>Building a rocket is hard. Each component requires careful thought and rigorous testing, with safety and reliability at the core of the designs. Rocket scientists and engineers come together to design everything from the navigation course to control systems, engines and landing gear. Once all the pieces are assembled and the systems are tested, we can put astronauts on board with confidence that things will go well.
