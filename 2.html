  <P>Regular programming is defining all possible scenarios. Whenever anything happens outside of this scenario, the program halts or crashes.
AI is about 'training' a program for a specific task and then letting it explore on it's own. We do not predefine all the scenarios that the program will face while completing this task. The program just 'figures out' what to do.
